# What the fork?!  Who did this?!

You have started working on a project that was previously managed by a colleague who has left your organization. Your supervisor has written comments in the file indicating where documentation and changes are needed, but you will need to exercise your judgement about what needs to be done. (Please don't delete any cells, since that affects the grading, but everything else is fair game)

Since you cannot locate the harddrive that contained the data referenced in the notebook, you will need to re-download the data. Another colleague thinks that it might have been MODIS data. Luckily you have used the same API before!

After trying to run the notebook, you see that the code in this notebook has additional issues with: 
* reproducibility 
* organization
* documentation

There are also some PEP 8 issues that make it hard to follow the workflow.

Your task is to:

1. Identify at least 3 bugs and 3 improvements that need to be made to the repository or notebook and document them as GitHub Issues. You may use the questions in the notebook as a guide. **You do not have to make all these changes in the notebook or repository.**
2. Reorganize this repository and update this README file to desribe:
    * A summary of the analysis
    * Where to get the data
    * How to run the notebook, including environment setup (you may link to earthdatascience.org)
2. Make this notebook run without errors
3. Make sure all of the code follows PEP 8 Standards
4. Add Markdown documentation as specified in the prompts in the notebook.

In this notebook you will be fixing code - NOT WRITING NEW CODE
